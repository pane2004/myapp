# Model Manual

In order for our model to run locally, the tensorflow model (.tf) must be converted into an optimized tensorflow lite model (.tflite)

To make changes to our Tensorflow model (more epochs, optimize, change dataset, etc) please follow the instructions below:

1. Locate the ```WWModel.ipynb``` file at the root directory of the repo

2. Copy and paste each section of the notebook into a Google Colab document or Jupyter notebook

3. Import the dataset.zip into your notebook

4. Make the neccessary edits to the model or database

5. Run each code snippet. The dataset should be unzipped as part of the code. 

6. Boom! A fresh model along with its labels should be downloaded
